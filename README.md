# How it's made

Art Plus Food application makes use of the following softwares:

- `NFTStorage`for data storage on IPFS that generates a transation hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

- `textile/eth-storage`: facilitated a fast way to store matadata for Garden comunities such: names, loocations, description, images, wallet address, and more. It was perfect for Garden comunities problem case to save their needs on the textile storage.

- `NFTPort` smooth the path of minting and donating NFTs for Garden comunities. This is a win win situation for our Garden comunities because they don't have to pay to contribute or mint NFTs.

- `Pocket Portal` smooth the path of deploying and hussle of paying such a big transactions to deploy our Garden comunitie's contract to a node using the Rinkeby network.

- `Skynet` facilitated the process of deploying our dApp front-end appliication in a seemless way.

- `Solidity` for the smart contract.

- `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for a faster development of the PetGram smart contract.

- `Ganache` for local blockchain development.

- `Rinkeby Network` the network that we deployed our dApp.

- `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui and Web3 to connect to blockchain.

npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
